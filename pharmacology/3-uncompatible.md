Most CNS-active durgs like <mark>Psychotropic e:g amphetamines</mark> are low in molecular weight and are very lipid soluble

<mark>neuroleptics e:g diazepam (valium), chlorpromazine(thorazine)</mark> are lipid soluble

<mark>heparin, insulin, interferon</mark> don't pass to milk due to high molecular weight

<mark>lithium</mark> pass to milk due to low molecular weight and low protein binding capacity

high protein binding medictions like <mark>NSAIDs, warfarin</mark> don't pass

<mark>proteins, peptides and amionglycosides</mark> are destroyed in GIT, <mark>Vancomycin and gaviscon</mark> are not absorbed in small intestine, <mark>domperidone</mark> is significanly metabolized in gut wall, so all of these with low bioavailability are safe

> [!caution]
> <mark>doxorubicin and methotrexate</mark> despite their low oral bioavailability are still contraindicated with BF

> [!NOTE]
> it takes <mark>5 times</mark> the half-live of a drug to be eliminated completely from the body\
> **short half-life**: <mark>penicillin, isoniazid</mark>\
> **long half-life**: <mark>radioactive iodine</mark>

### milk plasma ration

<mark>rantidine</mark> has high M/P ration, but the absolute dose transferred to infant is still subclinical due to low levels in mother plasma so can be given safely with lactation

### Active drugs
valacylovir(valtrex), codeine, Hydroxyzine (vistaril), fluoxetine(prozac) metabolites into the active drug form, so this form may have much longer half-life than prodrug or parent drug, more e:g include
- norfluoxetine from fluoxetine
- normeperidine from meperidine
- cetirizine(zytrec from hydroxyzine)

in below photo the yellow medication can be used with caution and the red ones are contraindicated with BF
