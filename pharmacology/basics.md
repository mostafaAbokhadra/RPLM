# Basics of Pharmacology Principles

### Ion-trapping
- some medications like the acidic media, and the milk is more acidic than the blood (milk ph=7.28 plasma ph=7.4) so certain weak bases medications fail to defuse backwards to plasma once in milk e:g <mark> barbiturates, rantidine</mark>
- weak acids are trapped in plasma and don't go to milk

### Molecular weight
- the lower the moluecular weight of the medication and the more lipid soluble the greater the diffusion across the bilayer lipid membrane(basal membrane of lactocyes)
- any medication with molecular weight exceeding <mark>500-800 dalton</mark> can't diffuse to breast milk

psychotropic durgs E:g <mark>amphetamines</mark> are low in molecular weight and hightly lipid soluble so high MILK/Plasm ratio occur

> [!IMPORTANT]
> any thing that pass through blood brain barrier can pass to the milk

### Lipohilicity
the more lipid soluble the medication the more likely it will transfet into human milk e:g <mark>CNS active drugs</mark> e:g <mark>diazepam, chlorpromazine</mark>

> [!NOTE]
> low M/P ratio suggest that very little durg enters milk\
> but hight M/P ratio <mark>may or may Not</mark> indicate high levels in milk

### durgs that pass to milk
- barbiturates
- rantidine
- psychotropic e:g amphetamines
- CNS active drugs e:g <mark>diazepam, chlorpromazine</mark>
