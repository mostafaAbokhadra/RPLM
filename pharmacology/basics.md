# Basics of Pharmacology Principles

### Ion-trapping
- some medications like the acidic media, and the milk is more acidic than the blood (milk ph=7.28 plasma ph=7.4) so certain weak bases medications fail to defuse backwards to plasma once in milk e:g <mark> barbiturates, rantidine</mark>
- weak acids are trapped in plasma and don't go to milk

### Molecular weight
- the lower the moluecular weight of the medication and the more lipid soluble the greater the diffusion across the bilayer lipid membrane(basal membrane of lactocyes)
- any medication with molecular weight exceeding <mark>500-800 dalton</mark> can't diffuse to breast milk

psychotropic durgs E:g <mark>amphetamines</mark> are low in molecular weight and hightly lipid soluble so high MILK/Plasm ratio occur

> [!IMPORTANT]
> any thing that pass through blood brain barrier can pass to the milk

### Lipohilicity
the more lipid soluble the medication the more likely it will transfet into human milk e:g <mark>CNS active drugs</mark> e:g <mark>diazepam, chlorpromazine</mark>

> [!NOTE]
> low M/P ratio suggest that very little durg enters milk\
> but hight M/P ratio <mark>may or may Not</mark> indicate high levels in milk

### Bioavailability
some durgs due to poor bioavailability even when high amount of it get diffuesed to mother's milk it actually don't harm infant cause these drugs are unstable in stomach and are incompletely absorbed by infants e:g <mark> heparin, insulin, 3rd generation Cephalosporins</mark>

### Calculation infant exposure
- this formula only can be applied to an exclusive breast feeding infant

**relative infant dose(RID)** = infant drug dose(mg/kg/day)لو هتوصف الدوا لل رضيع هتديله جرعه قد ايه / maternal dose(mg/kg/day)

> [!caution]
> result <mark> greater than 10%</mark> is considered level of concern

### infant high risk classification
1. **low risk**: older children > 6 months
2. **moderate risk**: < 6 months who suffers from metabolic problem
3. **high risk**
    - premature
    - neonates
    - unstable infants
    - infants with poor renal output

### durgs that pass to milk
- barbiturates
- rantidine
- psychotropic e:g amphetamines
- CNS active drugs e:g <mark>diazepam, chlorpromazine</mark>

### safe medication when BF
- heparin, insulin, 3rd generation Cephalosporins
