# Basics of Pharmacology Principles

### Ion-trapping
- some medications like the acidic media, and the milk is more acidic than the blood (milk ph=7.28 plasma ph=7.4) so certain weak bases medications fail to defuse backwards to plasma once in milk e:g <mark> barbiturates, rantidine</mark>
- weak acids are trapped in plasma and don't go to milk

### Molecular weight
- the lower the moluecular weight of the medication and the more lipid soluble the greater the diffusion across the bilayer lipid membrane(basal membrane of lactocyes)
