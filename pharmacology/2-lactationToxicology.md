if a mother take radioactive iodine and then expressed milk, the milk should be kept in freezer for at least <mark>8-10</mark> times the half-live period of the iodine and then can be fed to the infant, these bottle of milks should be kept in a seperate freezer

mother **shouldn't sleep** with their infant for <makr>3-23 nights</mark> and should stay a minimum of <mark>6 feets</mark> away from the infant, even changing diaper is hazardous !

### Types of radioactive iodine
1. **131**: half life is <mark>8.1 days</makr>
    - if taken in tracer dose(0.1microCi): mother can resume BF by <mark>8th day</mark>
    - larger dose resume BF by <mark>46th day</mark>

2. **125**: half life is <mark>60.2 days</mark>
discontinue BF

3. **123**: half life is <mark>13.2 hours</mark>
- dosse of < 2mCi mohter would express her milk for <mark>12-24 hours</mark>
