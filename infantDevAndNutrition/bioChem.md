# Bio Chemistry of human milk
- it is a living fluid (contains cells)
- it consists of more that 200 componenet
- 90% of human milk consist of water, others include fats coated with<mark>MFGM(milk fat globulin membrane)</mark>, protein mostly <mark>caseine as micelles</mark>, carb, micronutrients and boiactive component like hormones, antibodies, stem cells and enzymes

> [!NOTE]
> ratio of water to solids in human milk is approximately <mark>90:10</mark>\
> even in hot climate baby doesn't need extra water, human milk is sufficient

**cellular respiration** and how it turns nutrients like carbs, proteins, and fats into energy (ATP):

---

### 1. **Starting Point: Breaking Down Nutrients**
- **Carbs:** Glucose (a sugar) enters directly into the process.
- **Proteins:** Broken into amino acids, which can enter at different steps.
- **Fats:** Broken into glycerol and fatty acids. Fatty acids are converted into molecules that can enter later stages.

---

### 2. **Stages of Cellular Respiration**
#### a. **Glycolysis (in the cytoplasm)**  
   - Glucose is broken into two smaller molecules called **pyruvate**.  
   - This produces a small amount of ATP and "energy carriers" called **NADH**.  
   - **Net ATP gain:** 2 ATP.

---

#### b. **Pyruvate Conversion (entering mitochondria)**  
   - Each pyruvate is converted into a molecule called **Acetyl-CoA**.
   - This step releases **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** as a waste product.

---

#### c. **Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle, in mitochondria)**  
   - Acetyl-CoA goes through a cycle of chemical reactions.  
   - This produces:
     - **NADH and FADH₂** (energy carriers).  
     - A small amount of ATP.  
     - **CO₂** as a waste product.  

---

#### d. **Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and ATP Production**  
   - NADH and FADH₂ carry high-energy electrons to the ETC, located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria.  
   - Electrons "flow" through a series of proteins in the membrane, powering the production of ATP.  
   - Oxygen is the final electron acceptor, combining with electrons and hydrogen to form water.  
   - **Most of the ATP (around 28 molecules) is made in this stage.**

---

### 3. **End Result: Energy (ATP)**
- From one glucose molecule, about **30-32 ATP molecules** are made.
- ATP is the energy currency your cells use for everything—moving, building, and repairing!

---

### Why Oxygen Matters  
- Oxygen is essential because it helps "pull" electrons through the ETC. Without it, the process stops, and cells switch to a less efficient backup (fermentation).

---

### Key Idea:  
- **Glucose → Pyruvate → Acetyl-CoA → Energy carriers → ATP!**
- Fats and proteins enter at different points, but they ultimately funnel into the same system.

> human milk provides <mark>60-77Kcal/100ml</mark>, <mark>18-23Kcal/oz(30ml)</mark>\
> the total fat content in 24hours <mark>vary</mark> from <mark>20g/liter to 50g/liter</mark>\
> the average fat content of milk is secreted on <mark>day 7 </mark>of lactation by a woman is predictive of the average fat concentration in later lactation within one woman\
> the fat content of milk <mark>increase</mark> from the beginning to the end of the feeding session

fats are composed of C and H chains (carbon and hydrogen) that vary in length and double bonds(number and location) which reflects in the different functions of the fatty acids

fatty acids are the most abundant form of lipids in milk, mostly medium and long chains (c:10 - c:22)

**TriGlycerides** is 3 fatty acids connected to a glycerol, it is used for long term energy storage, it can be <mark>saturated</mark> or <mark>unsaturated(at least one double bond exist)</mark>

triglycerides constitue <mark>98%</mark> of total lipid in milkl

**lipase** is present in infant's intenstine and in breast milk which responsible for breaking down the lipids

lipids serve to transport fat soluble vitamins <makr>A, K, E, D</mark>

Milk Triglycedides are synthesized in the <mark>mammary alveolar cell</mark>, comes form two sources either derived from mom's plasma(absorped from diet by intestine or breakdown of adipose tissue), this type of triglycerides contains <mark>longer carbon chains</makr>, the second source is synthesized from the excess glucose within the mammary gland, and contains shorter carbons chain <mark>(maximum 16 carbons)</mark>

**unsaturated fats** may be mono unsaturated(containing only one double bond) like the <mark>Oleic acid (C18)</mark> which constitue <mark>42%</mark>of the total FA

medium chain fatty acid constiute another 42%

long chain poly unsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) constitute <mark>16%</mark> mostly <mark>lenoleic acid(omega-6) and arachidonic acid(omega-6)</mark>

> [!NOTE]
> both above acids belongs to omega-6 family

fat concentration of milk is affected by maternal fats, horomone secrtion and infant feeding method and behavior

transfats volume in milk can be increase by fat loss of eating unhealthy diet

vegetarian women contains <mark>5 times more</mark> long chain fatty acids

as lactation progress milk from both vegetarian and non-vegetarian contains more FAs principally synthesized in the mammary gland and less from the diet and adipose tissue
