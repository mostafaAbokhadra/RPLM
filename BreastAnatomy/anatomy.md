# Anatomy of the breast notes
- infant appetite is what determine the production of milk not the mother's capacity to produce milk
- breast size doesn't affect amount of milk

**Developmental cycle of mammary gland**

1. mammogenesis (emboryology)
2. lactogenesis (1 and 2)(physiology)
3. galctopiosis
4. involution

> [!NOTE] 
> it's ok if neonate produced milk, it will resolve sooner

## Anatomy

**breast tissue develops during puberty made of**

1. adipose tissue
2. glandular tissue
3. lactiferous ducts

the glandular tissue consists of the **alveolus** which is a modified sweat gland made up of alveolar cell which actually **make the milk**, wrapping around the alveolus are special **myoepithelial cells** that **squeeze down and push the milk** out of the alveolus, down the **lactiferous ducts** and out of one of the pores on the nipple at which it enters the baby's mouth, when the breast are full of milk they get heavy and there is suspensory ligaments called **cooper's ligaments** which help hold them up against the chest wall, during pregnancy , **human placental lactogen and progesterone** from placenta, **prolactin** form anterior pituitary gland stimulate the growth of more glandular tissue to produce milk

areola gland called **Montgomery**  gland looking like bumps on the areola start to produce lipoid fluid which moisturizes the nipple.

### mamaogenesis
**milk line** from axilla to groin 

**polythelia**: accessory nipple

**polymastia** : accessory breast

aeorola is the most sensitive not the nipple, nipple don't have sesnsory supply
