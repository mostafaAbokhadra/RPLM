### Ankyloglossia
The presence of a sublingual frenulum ( a small fold of tissue that secures the motion of a mobile organ in the body.) that changes the appearance or function of the infant’s tongue because of its decreased length, lack of elasticity, or attachment too distal beneath the tongue or too close to or onto the gingival ridge

‘snap back’ – something
breastfeeding supporters often call
‘clicking’ at the breast. The tongue
tries to extend forward but a tight
lingual frenulum ‘snaps’ the tongue
back – every few sucks or even every
suck and makes a characteristic
‘clicking’ noise

treated by Frenotomy (a.k.a. frenulotomy or frenulectomy) is the procedure in which the lingual frenulum is cut.

scissors is the
gold standard for frenotomy

when due to poor latching baby swallows a lot of air

> why ? The baby can not be able to swallow correctly because he can not raise the tongue.

speech impairement is enhanced by frenulectomy

can cause sleep apnea

#### Results
- <mark>8</mark> indicates normal tongue function
- <mark>6 or 7</mark> is considered as borderline
- <mark>5 or below</mark> suggests an impairment of tongue function.

Selection of infants for frenotomy required an additional breastfeeding assessment, but all infants with a score of 4 or less in the audits had a frenotomy, following parental consent

you can assess tongue tie by <mark>hazelbark</mark> assessment tool

### revision
Arterial supply of breast -> <mark>internal mammary, lateral thoracic</mark>, subclavian arteryies

venous drainage -> subclavian vein

lymphatic drainage -> axillary lymph node

nerve supply -> 4th intercostal nerve, supplies left breast on 4 Oclock and reach nipple from 5 Oclock, and right breast from 8 Oclock and reach nipple form 7 Oclock

### breast examination during pregenency
- expressing milk
- asymmetry is normal (left bigger than right)
- engorgement is normal
- pigmentation and areola increase
- nipple more protactile

if you want to assess if breast is small or patient has hypomastia use tanner scale

### breast hypoplasia
