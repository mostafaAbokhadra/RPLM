### Ankyloglossia
The presence of a sublingual frenulum ( a small fold of tissue that secures the motion of a mobile organ in the body.) that changes the appearance or function of the infant’s tongue because of its decreased length, lack of elasticity, or attachment too distal beneath the tongue or too close to or onto the gingival ridge

‘snap back’ – something
breastfeeding supporters often call
‘clicking’ at the breast. The tongue
tries to extend forward but a tight
lingual frenulum ‘snaps’ the tongue

suck and makes a characteristic
‘clicking’ noise

treated by Frenotomy (a.k.a. frenulotomy or frenulectomy) is the procedure in which the lingual frenulum is cut.

scissors is the
gold standard for frenotomy
